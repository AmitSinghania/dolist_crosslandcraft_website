          <p>
            Keeping in sync with the original architectural features of the
            erstwhile bungalow, The Commoner’s Kitchen offers a multitude of
            ‘framed views’, that were cast from the existing arches between its
            many rooms. These arches gracefully converted into vaults, are used
            to dynamically outline the café’s various activities and create
            focal points for its statuesque counter and picturesque seating
            areas. Continuing with the approach of spawning such arresting
            views, a long and rustic acacia wood community table, aligned
            underneath a sparkling assemblage of cane lights from Surat’s Art
            Lights, exemplifies a rhythmic composition. An assortment of
            custom-made chairs, stools, and benches stationed at the community
            table add to the play of an artistic serenity. With a seating layout
            that perfectly frames the outdoor garden, the restaurant opens up to
            lush greenery and brings in delicate patches of natural light.

          <h1>Cane furniture An Introduction </h1>
          <p>
            Cane furniture—a breakaway from wood being your home’s principal
            natural material statement, and a bang-on-trend way to bring texture
            into any room, item of furniture or accent piece. Long gone is the
            association between wicker seating and the conservatory. Now, this
            prized, plant-based fibre is sought after all over the home so that
            the beholder gets a taste of the exotic in their interior without
            oversized palm prints, pineapple or flamingo motifs or a
            carnivalesque colour scheme.
            <br /> <i>THE BEAUTY OF CANE LIGHTING</i> A huge trend from the
            1970s resurrected at this year’s Maison et Objet show in Paris, cane
            lighting is set to make noise through 2020 and 2021. Choose a pretty
            cane pendant or table lamp, and the shade will not only be a beauty
            to behold, but it will cast intriguing shadow play around the room.
            Whether you opt for a ceiling light or a shade for a floor or desk
            lamp, the available styles of cane lampshades are plentiful. Go for
            a scallop-edged design for a pretty take on the style. or something
            slender and cylindrical if contemporary is more to your taste. And
            keep a close eye out for those more creative cane lighting ideas
            that feature cane as a cover for the lamp base, teamed with a
            neutral fabric shade.
